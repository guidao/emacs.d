#+TITLE: Valign.el

This package provides visual alignment for Org tables on GUI Emacs. It can properly align tables containing variable-pitch font, CJK characters and images. In the meantime, the text-based alignment generated by Org mode is left untouched.

To use this package, load it and run =M-x valign-mode RET=. And any Org tables in Org mode should be automatically aligned. If you want to align a table manually, run =M-x valign-table RET= on a Org table.

You can choose from the two styles by customizing ~valign-separator-row-style~.
